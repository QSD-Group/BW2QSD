    "``BW2QSD`` is (currently) a lite package to leverage the [``Brightway2`` platform](https://2.docs.brightway.dev/index.html) for convenient importing of life cycle impact characterization factors (CFs) and use them in packages developed for quantitative sustainable design (QSD) of technologies and systems hosted on [the GitHub homepage of QSD-Group](https://github.com/QSD-Group). You can certainly use this package to just extract the CF values and use in other ways you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that ``Brightway2`` is a powerful platform with many capacities, ``BW2QSD`` is not intended to leverage all of them, as the same suggests, ``BW2QSD`` is tailored for the QSD. There are still some manual work required to clean up the data and format them into the requirement of QSD pcakges, but the entire process can be automated with future development of both ``BW2QSD`` and QSD packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you will find this tutorial much easier to follow if you have familiarized yourself with the basic concepts in ``Brightway2``."

    "    Additionally, if you do ``pip install brightway2`` and then later uses ``conda install -c defaults -c conda-forge -c cmutel -c haasad eidl`` to install eidl through conda, conda will complain about having installed ``brightway2`` and its dependencies. Then you will need to ``pip uninstall`` the many packages that comes with ``Brightway2`` and manually remove caches.\n",
